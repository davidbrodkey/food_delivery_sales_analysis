Analysis of Food Delivery Data

Attached is a dataset of fake sample orders from customers. The columns are as follows:

1. time_opened - a timestamp of when the order was placed
2. customer_id - hash of a uniquely identifying customer attribute
3. Subtotal - an integer representing the cents the customer paid for the order. This can be converted to dollars.

1. We want to understand the purchasing habits of our users. Compute summary statistics and extract insights you think are helpful. Write a short analysis of your findings. This should be something that can be sent company wide in a single email.
2. Conduct a cohort analysis to understand our retention and churn. You can choose to present this information however you would like. Tables or visualizations are all acceptable. Please interpret the results.
3. Compute an LTV estimate for these customers based on their sales and churn.
