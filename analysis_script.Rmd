# Question 1

The prompt calls for an email style message. For time purposes I will go with bullet points and potentially circle back to an email format time permitting.

Early EDA Insights 
- Majority of sales are in about 15-25 dollar range. See a double peak would like to investigate further. Long tail as expected seems to be almost all sales under 100
- Sales data is from start of Feb to Mar 21. Strong rise of sales over time. Partial last day removed
- Sales Mon-Thur are pretty consistent. Large uptick Fri/Sat/Sun with Sat being pick. Fri/Sun are about 50% higher than average weekday. Sat is about double a normal weekday. (Note should check is we have different number of days of week in dataset, partial weeks, would be better to average by day. Skipping for time purposes.)
- The time of orders comes in two major peaks. About a half hour after noon is the first peak for lunch. About 6:30 is the dinner peak. Would be interesting to see how this changes by day of week.
